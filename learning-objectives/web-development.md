# Learning Objectives for Web Development

- **Performing Web Development**:
  - A learner will write a component in Markdown, HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript
    that contains up to one-hundred lines of source code and has the following
    characteristics:
    - Has variable names that adhere to an industry-standard coding style.
    - Has descriptive comments for both the component declaration and the
      component's code that adhere to an industry-standard coding style.
    - Features a source code format that adheres to an industry-standard coding
      style.
    - Passes a test suite, thereby demonstrating that it furnishes a correct
      implementation of the component's specification.
    - Performs the specified operations in an efficient fashion, as determined
      through experiments that evaluate the component's performance.
    - Correctly uses assignment statements, iteration constructs, conditional
      logic, recursion, and other features of the chosen language in a way that
      passes the test suite, works efficiently, and conveys the intended purpose
      of the component.
  - A learner will write a complete web site consisting of between one and five
    hundred lines of source code that correctly displays on a wide variety of
    devices, including, but not limited to, laptops, desktops, tablets, and
    mobile phones.

- **Using Web Development Tools**:
  - A learner will use a web development environment to complete these tasks
    while implementing a web site consisting of between one and five hundred
      lines of code:
    - Install, upgrade, and use the programs needed for developing web sites
      that use Markdown, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    - Use Docker to run without error a program a Python program in an isolated
      container that can run the test suite and autograding tools.
    - Use testing to detect a failure in a web site and then effectively use
      tools like a text editor and a terminal window to find and fix the
      failure, ultimately confirming that the web site no longer contains the
      failure and the fix did not compromise other functions in the program.

- **Using Version Control Systems**:
  - A learner will use the GitHub version control system in the following
    fashion:
    - Clone a GitHub repository without error using either a terminal window or
      a Git integration in a text editor like VS Code.
    - Write short and descriptive commit messages that explain the specific way
      in which a commit changes the source code and documentation in the GitHub
      repository.
    - Use GitHub pre-commit hooks to ensure that all of the source code,
      technical writing, and commit messages adhere to the industry standards
      for content and format.
    - Navigate reports produced by GitHub Actions so as to determine which
      aspects of a GitHub repository do not adhere to a project's specification.
    - Use the GitHub Flow model to implement specific features in a branch of a
      GitHub repository and then merge that branch to the main one only after
      all the checks run by GitHub Actions pass as required.
    - Create and discuss programming and technical writing issues through the
      use of the GitHub issue tracker, furnishing descriptive issue titles and
      descriptions that adhere to industry best practices.
    - Submit completed projects that pass all of the instructor-provided and
      industry-standard checks, as evidenced through the report of a passing
      build by GitHub Actions.
