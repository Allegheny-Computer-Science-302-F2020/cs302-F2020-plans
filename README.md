## Introduction

This repository contains all of the course planning documents for Computer
Science 302 Fall 2020, Web Development. This course introduces the principles
and applications of computer science that arise during the design,
implementation, and maintenance of mobile-ready web sites. More details about
the course are available in the [course
syllabus](https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-302-F2020/cs302-F2020-syllabus).
A collection of slides for each week of the course is also available in the

repository.

## Course Description

An introduction to the principles and applications of computer science with an
emphasis on understanding the intercultural perspectives that arise during the
design, implementation, and maintenance of mobile-ready web sites. Participating
in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students learn the
computational methods needed to create web sites that are useful to people from
different cultures and nationalities. Students also investigate approaches to
developing efficient, accessible, and aesthetically pleasing web sites that
adhere to the international standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium.
During a weekly laboratory session students use state-of-the-art web development
technologies to complete projects, reporting on their results through both
written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own
[departmentally approved
laptop](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/resources/laptops/); a limited number of
laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.
