## GitHub

Throughout this semester, the course instructor will use GitHub to deliver to
you all of the starting source code and documentation for the technical
challenges, practical assignments, and laboratory assignments. In addition to
using GitHub to submit all of your assignments to the course instructor, you can
use GitHub to engage with the instructor and the student technical leaders to
ask questions about your work. The GitHub repositories that you create for your
assignments will also serve as an archive of the material that you can review
for the quizzes and examinations that you will take. To learn more about GitHub,
you can visit the following web sites:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/)
- [GitHub Guides on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/githubguides)
- [Git Version Control Tool](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

## Visual Studio Code

Since the [2019 Stack Overflow Technology
Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology) reports that
Visual Studio Code (or VSCode) is the most popular development environment, you
will exclusively use it to complete web programming and technical writing
projects in the field of web development. In addition to providing a wide
variety of program analysis, debugging, linting, and testing tools, VSCode
supports live share programming where two programmers can work together in the
same development environment! VSCode also features an extremely popular and
powerful web programming extensions that will make your assignments
significantly easier. To learn more about VSCode, you can visit the following
web sites:

- [VSCode Code Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [VSCode Live Share Overview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/)
- [VSCode Live Share Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare)
- [VSCode Live Share Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack)

## Docker

Since a Docker container provides a wide variety of programming tools that
support the implementation and assessment of a web site component, it makes it
easier for you to start programming right away! You are invited to use Docker
Desktop to run programs that the course instructor provides to you through a
Docker container. To learn more about Docker, you can visit the following web
sites:

- [Can I Run Docker?](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/canirundocker/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Docker Desktop Overview](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
- [Install Docker Desktop on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
- [Install Docker Desktop on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)

## Markdown

In addition to implementing and testing programs in a web development
programming language, you will write technical documentation using Markdown, a
formatting language that enables you to use rules to control the display of
plain text in your GitHub repository. For instance, Markdown has features that
enable it to display source code, itemized lists, and graphics. Importantly, you
can edit Markdown files inside of your VSCode text editor and store them in your
GitHub repository. Students will write in Markdown as part of the laboratory and
practical assignments and the course examinations. You can learn more about the
Markdown language for technical writing by visiting these web sites:

- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
- [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## Web Programming Languages

Along with using Markdown to contain some of the content in your web site, you
will use HTML to add content and meta-content, CSS to style its components, and
JavaScript to add interactive elements to the site. Students will use all of
these web programming languages and a wide variety of frameworks and libraries
that build on them as part of the laboratory and practical assignments and the
web design portfolio. You can learn more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by
visiting these web sites:

- [Mozilla Development Network Guide to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)
- [Mozilla Development Network Guide to CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference)
- [Visual Guide to CSS](https://cssreference.io/)
- [The State of CSS Survey](https://stateofcss.com/)
- [Mozilla Development Network Guide to JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)
- [The State of JavaScript Survey](https://stateofjs.com/)
- [The Best of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS](https://bestofjs.org/)

## Python for Web Development

The Python programming language is simple and powerful! Since there are a wide
variety of development tools and packages that support programming in Python, we
will use this language when we need to start a web server or when we need to
implement a server component for our web site. Since the version of Python
delivered by your operating system may be out of date (or Python may not be
readily available on your operating system), you are invited to install version
3.8 of the Python programming language by using either the Pyenv or Pyenv-win
tools that are available for download from GitHub. You can learn more about
Python by visiting these web sites:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
- [Pyenv-Win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win)

## Python Web Development Packages

The Python programming language features a wide variety of popular and powerful
packages that enable you to more effectively write efficient and correct
programs. Although we will only explore a limited number of Python packages this
semester, we will use the Poetry packaging and dependency management tool
support the installation of the packages that you will use to complete the
course assignments. We will also use the Pytest testing framework to write and
run test cases that help us to know whether or not our Python program is
correct. Finally, we will use the Streamlit system to create web-based
interfaces for our Python applications that explore the field of discrete
structures. Of course, there are many other Python packages that you can explore
through the Python Package Index. You can learn more about these Python packages
by visiting these web sites:

- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/)
- [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/)
- [HTTP Servers in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html)
- [Mozilla Web Docs for Python Web Servers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server)
