# Laboratory Assignments

- **Assigned**: At the start of a remote laboratory session every Tuesday
- **Due**: At the start of the remote laboratory session one week after it was assigned

Building on material in the textbooks and the content covered during the
following weeks of the semester, laboratory assignments have the following
goals:

- Equip a learner to solve new problems in the field of web development by
  applying &mdash; in a new way &mdash; your knowledge of the facts, techniques,
  and rules of the programming languages used for mobile-ready web design.

- Afford a learner the opportunity to compare and contrast implementations of
  web site components in a programming language, enabling you to find evidence
  to support both the generalization and simplification of a component type.

- Enable a learner to develop the skills needed conduct experiments and use
  experimental results to present and defend judgements about the efficiency,
  effectiveness, and correctness of a web site component implemented in a
  programming language.

Building on the concepts and source code in the textbook and practical
assignments, laboratory assignments invite you to complete tasks like the
following:

- After using a text editor and a terminal window to refactor the implementation
  of a web site component to ensure that it strikes the right balance between
  understandability, generalizability, and specialization, justify and
  reflectively examine your decisions in technical writing.

- Use a text editor and a terminal window to design, implement, test, and use an
  experimentation framework to run experiments to evaluate a web site component.
  Using the data collected from the experiments, evaluate the implementation of
  the web site component as you consider, for instance, its efficiency,
  correctness, and design.

- After using a text editor and a terminal window to design, implement, test,
  and use an integrated mobile-ready web site that features user documentation,
  a test suite, and a complete web-based interface, critique the quality of the
  web site based on pre-defined criteria involving aesthetics and accessibility.
