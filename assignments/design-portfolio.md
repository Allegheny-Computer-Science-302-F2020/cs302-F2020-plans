# Web Design Portfolio

- **Assigned**: Before the middle of the academic semester
- **Due**: At the very end of the academic semester

Building on material in the textbooks and the content covered during the entire
semester semester, the web design portfolio has the following goals:

- Equip a learner to solve new problems in the field of web development by
  applying &mdash; in a new way &mdash; your knowledge of the facts, techniques,
  and rules of the programming languages used for mobile-ready web design.

- Afford a learner the opportunity to compare and contrast implementations of
  web site components in a programming language, enabling you to find evidence
  to support both the generalization and specialization of a component type.

- Enable a learner to develop the technical skills needed to build and deploy
  their own mobile-ready web site, either by starting from scratch or by reusing
  and customizing a learner-chosen web design template.

Building on the concepts and source code in the textbook, practical assignments,
and laboratory assignments, the web design portfolio invites you to complete
tasks like the following:

- Compare and contrast different web development frameworks and libraries,
  ultimately picking the most suitable one to fulfill stated objectives for a
  mobile-ready web site with a specific theme.

- Leveraging pre-existing web development frameworks and libraries, pick the
  most suitable web site components and then use them to build, test, document,
  deploy, and maintain an integrated mobile-ready web site.

- After using a text editor, a terminal window, and a web browser to design,
  implement, test, and use an integrated mobile-ready web site that features
  user documentation, a test suite, and a complete web-based interface, critique
  the overall quality of the web site based on pre-defined criteria involving
  aesthetics and accessibility.
