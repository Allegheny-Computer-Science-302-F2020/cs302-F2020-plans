# Web Design Portfolio

- **Assigned**: Before the middle of the academic semester
- **Due**: At the very end of the academic semester

Building on material in the textbooks and the content covered during the entire
semester semester, the web design portfolio has the following goals:

- Help a learner to demonstrate that they can remember learned material by
  recalling facts, basic concepts, and answers to questions presented in the
  textbook.

- Allow a learner to demonstrate an understanding of facts and ideas by
  translating, interpreting, and stating the main technical ideas presented in
  the textbook.

- Equip a learner to solve new problems in the field of web development by
  applying &mdash; in a new way &mdash; your knowledge of the facts, techniques,
  and rules of the programming languages used for mobile-ready web design.

- Afford a learner the opportunity to compare and contrast implementations of
  web site components in a programming language, enabling you to find evidence
  to support both the generalization and specialization of a component type.

- Enable a learner to develop the technical skills needed to build and deploy
  their own mobile-ready web site, either by starting from scratch or by reusing
  and customizing a learner-chosen web design template.

Building on the concepts and source code in the textbook, practical assignments,
and laboratory assignments, the web design portfolio invites you to complete
tasks like the following:

- Use a text editor, a terminal window, and a web browser to design, implement,
  and use a new component of a web site, describing its appearance and behavior
  when provided with different user interactions and explaining why you decided
  to implement it in the chosen fashion.

- Use a text editor, a terminal window, and a web browser to write and run
  (manual or automated) test cases for a component of a web site, describing its
  appearance and behavior when provided with different inputs and explaining why
  you decided to implement it in the chosen fashion.

- After using a text editor, a terminal window, and a web browser to refactor
  the implementation of a web site component to ensure that it strikes the right
  balance between understandability, generalizability, and specialization,
  justify and reflectively examine your decisions in technical writing.

- Compare and contrast different web development frameworks and libraries,
  ultimately picking the most suitable one to fulfill stated objectives for a
  mobile-ready web site with a specific theme.

- Leveraging pre-existing web development frameworks and libraries, pick the
  most suitable web site components and then use them to build, test, document,
  deploy, and maintain an integrated mobile-ready web site.

- After using a text editor, a terminal window, and a web browser to design,
  implement, test, and use an integrated mobile-ready web site that features
  user documentation, a test suite, and a complete web-based interface, critique
  the overall quality of the web site based on pre-defined criteria involving
  aesthetics and accessibility.
