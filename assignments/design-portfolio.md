# Web Design Portfolio

- **Assigned**: Before the middle of the academic semester
- **Due**: At the very end of the academic semester

Building on material in the textbooks and the content covered during the entire
semester semester, the web design portfolio has the following goals:

- Equip a learner to solve new problems in the field of web development by
  applying &mdash; in a new way &mdash; your knowledge of the facts, techniques,
  and rules of the programming languages used for mobile-ready web design.

- Afford a learner the opportunity to compare and contrast implementations of
  web site components realized in a web programming language, enabling you to
  find evidence to support both the generalization and simplification of a
  component type.

- Enable a learner to develop the skills needed to build and deploy their own
  mobile-ready web site, either starting from scratch or from learner-chosen
  template.

Building on the concepts and source code in the textbook, practical assignments,
and laboratory assignments, the web design portfolio invites you to complete
tasks like the following:

- Compare and contrast different web development frameworks and libraries,
  ultimately picking the best one to fulfill stated objectives for a
  mobile-ready web site.

- Using pre-existing web development frameworks and libraries, pick the best web
  site components and then use them to build and test an integrated mobile-ready
  web site.

- After using a text editor and a terminal window to design, implement, test,
  use, and deploy an integrated mobile-ready web site that features user
  documentation, a test suite, and a complete web-based interface, critique the
  quality of the web site based on pre-defined criteria involving aesthetics and
  accessibility.
