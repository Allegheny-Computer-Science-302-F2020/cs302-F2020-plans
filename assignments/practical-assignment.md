# Practical Assignments

- **Assigned**: At the end of an in-person classroom session for a specific team
- **Due**: At the start of the remote practical session one week after it was assigned

Building on material in the textbooks and the content covered during that day's
in-person classroom session, practical assignments have the following goals:

- Help a learner to demonstrate that you can remember learned material by recalling
  facts, basic concepts, and answers to questions presented in the textbooks.

- Allow a learner to demonstrate an understanding of facts and ideas by translating,
  interpreting, and stating the main technical ideas presented in the textbooks.

- Equip a learner to solve new problems in the field of web development by
  applying &mdash; in a new way &mdash; your knowledge of the facts, techniques,
  and rules of the programming languages used for mobile-ready web design.

Building on the concepts and source code in the textbook, practical assignments
invite you to complete tasks like the following:

- Use a text editor and a terminal window to design, implement, and use a new
  component of a web site, describing its appearance and behavior when provided
  with different user inputs and explaining why you decided to implement it in
  the chosen fashion.

- Use a text editor and a terminal window to write and run (manual or automated)
  test cases for a component of a web site, describing its appearance and
  behavior when provided with different inputs and explaining why you decided to
  implement it in the chosen fashion.
