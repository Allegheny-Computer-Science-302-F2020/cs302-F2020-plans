# Practical Assignments

- **Assigned**: At the end of an in-person classroom session for a specific team
- **Due**: At the start of the remote practical session one week after it was assigned

Building on material in the textbook and the content covered during that day's
in-person classroom session, practical assignments have the following goals:

- Help a learner to demonstrate that they can remember learned material by
  recalling facts, basic concepts, and answers to questions presented in the
  textbook.

- Allow a learner to demonstrate an understanding of facts and ideas by
  translating, interpreting, and stating the main technical ideas presented in
  the textbook.

- Equip a learner to solve new problems in the field of web development by
  applying &mdash; in a new way &mdash; their knowledge of the facts, techniques,
  and rules of the chosen programming languages.

Building on the concepts and source code in the textbook, practical assignments
invite you to complete tasks like the following:

- Use a text editor and a terminal window to implement and/or modify the
  provided implementation of a web site component from the textbook, explaining,
  for instance, your modification's impact on the original component and the new
  behavior of the modified component.

- Use a text editor and a terminal window to design, implement, and use a new
  component of a web site, describing its appearance and behavior when provided
  with different user interactions and explaining why you decided to implement
  it in the chosen fashion.

- Use a text editor and a terminal window to write and run (manual or automated)
  test cases for a component of a web site, describing its appearance and
  behavior when provided with different inputs and explaining why you decided to
  implement it in the chosen fashion.
